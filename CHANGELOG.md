# v1.0-pre
I've been sitting on this project since April 16th, 2024, and it's time to change that. The goal of the changes below is to add some low effort polish before release. Note that this is still unfinished and an update fixing way more issues will come eventually.

Changes from private build:
- clicking on media dropdown will do nothing (it's activating by hovering. clicking would just close it, not open it)
- use seek button as image for the media looping button instead of the video hide button
- video resizing dropdown was removed, ALL the buttons didn't work
- removed usage of my unreleased EX lib (used in 1 line and nowhere else lol)
- renamed "ID3" button in media dropdown to "Metadata"
- the version number in the about dialogue now links to releases
- added "About" button in toolbar
- created README.md and CHANGELOG.md
- added page description and tags with <meta>
