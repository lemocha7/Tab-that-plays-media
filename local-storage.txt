"Tab that plays media" uses Local Storage to store these settings:

	"ttpm/volume":              playing volume of media
	"ttpm/loop":                if media loops when ended
	"ttpm/video-hide":          if video is displayed or not
	"ttpm/set-titleScroll":     webpage title will scroll if too long
	"ttpm/set-ignoreTitle":     when setting media title, always ignore ID3 metadata

With Local Storage blocked, the app will still work BUT these settings will not be saved when exiting / reloading.
